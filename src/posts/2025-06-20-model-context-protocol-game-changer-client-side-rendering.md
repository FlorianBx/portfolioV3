# Model Context Protocol (MCP): A Game-Changer for Client-Side Rendering

Let’s geek out for a second: the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is shaking up how we do client-side rendering. If you care about accessibility, SEO, performance, or just want to build cooler stuff, MCP is a breath of fresh air for modern frameworks.

---

## What’s the Point of MCP?

MCP was born to solve the headaches of **isomorphic apps** (sharing code between client and server), especially for **progressive server-side rendering** and **async component composition**. Sounds fancy, but it’s super practical.

---

## The Old Ways: SPA & SSR Woes

### SPA (Single Page Application)

- All rendering happens in the browser.
- Initial state is injected globally via `window.__INITIAL_STATE__`.
- Problems:
  - Big initial payload
  - Tricky hydration
  - Hard to manage state per component

### SSR (Server-Side Rendering)

- HTML is generated server-side per request.
- Data is injected globally, then reused on the client.
- Problems:
  - Tight coupling between rendering and data
  - Loss of modularity

---

## MCP: One Model Per Component

### The Principle

**Model Context Protocol** totally decouples your **Vue/React/etc. components** from their **data sources**. Here’s the magic:

> Every component can declare and expose its own data “model,” totally independent from the rest of the app.

### Two Key Functions:

- `useModel()` → in the component: reads or prepares its data
- `getModel()` → on the server: fetches or prepares data for `useModel`

---

## Example in Vue 3 with `<script setup lang="ts">`

### Component: `UserCard.vue`

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
const { data: user } = await useModel<User>()
</script>

<template>
  <div v-if="user">
    <h2>{{ user.name }}</h2>
    <p>{{ user.email }}</p>
  </div>
</template>
```

### Server Side (`getModel.ts`)

```ts
export default async function getModel({ params }) {
  const id = params.userId
  const user = await fetch(`/api/user/${id}`).then(r => r.json())
  return user
}
```

➡️ This model lets you:

* Fetch data locally per component
* Get way more modular
* Do progressive, component-based rendering
* Hydrate only what you need

## Typical Use Cases

| Use Case                | What MCP Enables                        |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Async components        | Render each as soon as it’s ready        |
| Streaming rendering     | Send HTML as it’s ready                  |
| High reusability        | Each component manages its own model     |
| Better accessibility    | Content renders faster, sooner           |

## Quick Comparison

| Approach  | Data Loading      | Rendering      | Modularity | Fine-Grained Hydration |
| --------- | ---------------- | ------------- | ---------- | --------------------- |
| SPA       | Client-side       | Client        | Medium     | No                    |
| SSR       | Server global     | Server        | Low        | No                    |
| SSR + MCP | Per component     | Server        | High       | Yes                   |
| SSG       | At build time     | Static HTML   | Very high  | N/A                   |

## Conclusion

**Model Context Protocol** is a slick answer to the limits of old-school SSR:

* Faster, more progressive rendering
* More modular and testable components
* Perfect fit for new frameworks (Nuxt 4, Next.js App Router, etc.)

MCP is a building block for the next-gen, fully modular web. If you love clean code and fast sites, you’ll love this.
