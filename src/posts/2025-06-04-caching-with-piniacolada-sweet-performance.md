# Caching with Piniacolada: Sweet Performance for Your App

Want to make your app snappier and cut down on API calls? Meet **Piniacolada**—a super easy, high-performance caching library that’s as refreshing as its name. Here’s how to use it, from one performance fan to another.

---

## What’s Caching, Anyway?

Caching is all about **temporarily storing** data or API results so you can **reuse** them instead of fetching or recalculating every time.

✅ Perks:
- Fewer API calls
- Faster app
- Less server load

---

## The Goal

Use **Piniacolada** to:
1. Cache data
2. Manage caches with a simple API
3. Boost your app’s performance

---

## 1. Install Piniacolada

```bash
npm install piniacolada
```

---

## 2. Cache Some Data

Let’s say you want to cache the results of an API call:

```javascript
import Piniacolada from 'piniacolada';

const cache = new Piniacolada();

// Function to fetch data
async function getData() {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
  return response.json();
}

// Cache data for 1 hour
cache.set('data', await getData(), 3600000);

// Get data from cache
const cachedData = cache.get('data');
```

---

## 3. Use Piniacolada in a Function

Here’s a handy function that caches results for you:

```javascript
import Piniacolada from 'piniacolada';

const cache = new Piniacolada();

async function fetchAndCacheData(key, callback) {
  if (cache.has(key)) {
    return cache.get(key);
  } else {
    const data = await callback();
    cache.set(key, data, 3600000);
    return data;
  }
}

// Example usage
fetchAndCacheData('data', async () => {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
  return response.json();
});
```

---

## 4. Clearing the Cache

To clear everything:

```javascript
cache.clear();
```

Or just one item:

```javascript
cache.delete('data');
```

---

## 5. Error Handling

Always handle errors when caching:

```javascript
try {
  // Caching code
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Error while caching:', error);
}
```

---

## Conclusion

With **Piniacolada**, caching is easy and your app gets a sweet performance boost. Perfect for:

* Apps that hit APIs a lot
* Projects where speed matters
* Anyone who wants simple, effective cache management

Give it a try—your users (and your server) will thank you!
