If you’re building for the web, **Chrome DevTools** is your best friend. Whether you’re poking around the DOM, chasing a sneaky JavaScript bug, or just wondering why your API call is sulking, here’s the chill, passionate guide you wish you’d read sooner.

---

## Quick Access

**Keyboard shortcuts:**

- **Windows/Linux:** `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I`
- **Mac:** `Cmd+Option+I`

Other ways:

- **Right-click** → *Inspect*
- **Chrome menu:** ⋮ → *More Tools* → *Developer Tools*

---

## The "Sources" Tab: Debugging HQ

Here’s where you’ll find:

- **File tree** of loaded scripts
- **Code editor**
- **Debugging column**: breakpoints, scope, watch, and more

---

## Setting Breakpoints Like a Boss

### Simple Line

Click to the left of the **line number** to add a breakpoint.

### Conditional Breakpoint

Right-click → *Add conditional breakpoint*  
Example:  
```js
item.length > 0
```

### Event Breakpoint

In the **Event Listener Breakpoints** panel, pick an event (like `click` or `scroll`). DevTools will pause when it fires.

### Logpoint

Like a `console.log`, but built into DevTools. Trace stuff without cluttering your code.

## Stepping Through Code

![Step through](https://developer.chrome.com/images/tools/devtools-step.png)

When paused:

* **Step over**: Run the line, don’t enter functions
* **Step into**: Dive into the called function
* **Step out**: Pop back out to the parent
* **Resume**: Let it roll

---

## Watching Variables

* **Scope**: See all variables at the pause point
* **Watch**: Track a custom expression (like `user.isLoggedIn`)
* **Console**: Test ideas, tweak values, or mess with the DOM (`$0`, `$_`, etc.)

---

## Network Tab: API Detective

* Track **API requests** (`XHR`, `fetch`)
* See **headers**, **payloads**, **responses**
* Simulate slow connections (`3G`, `offline`)
* Copy a request: `Copy as fetch`, `Copy as curl`

---

## Performance Tab: Speed Guru

* **Performance**: Record a session to spot slowdowns (layout, scripting, etc.)
* **Memory**: Find memory leaks with snapshots
* **Coverage**: See unused code (`Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Coverage")

---

## Elements Tab: Live HTML & CSS Playground

In **Elements**, you can:

* Edit **HTML** or **CSS** live
* Add/remove **classes**
* Test **media queries** or **animations**
* Right-click → *Copy > JS path* or *selector*

---

## Pro Tips

* `$_`: Last value returned in console
* `$0` to `$4`: Last inspected elements
* **Snippets**: Store reusable scripts in *Sources > Snippets*
* **Command Menu**: `Ctrl+Shift+P` to search for any feature
